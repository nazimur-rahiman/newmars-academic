- description: "Cabin noise has come down significantly. It is almost like a car. No leaks at all even from the openable panels. It is adding to the looks of the vehicle. I would say it is a **must buy** for Thar. Openable panels are simply great to have. Overall, I am highly satisfied. Thanks to Mr. Prabhu and his team."

- description: "No leaks, no cracking, waterproof even in heavy rain and very easy to take off the roof panel. No rattling noise from the fastners. Everything is absolutely fine with it and it is recommended to interested That owners."
