**Swing Open Rear Door** The rear panel of the hard top is now integrated with the factory tail-gate; convenient for everyday use.

**Ceramic Blankets** No PU Puff between inner and outer shell â€“ Ceramic Blankets are used instead. This allows for even finish without burdening the shells with pressure. The material is also fire resistant.

**Openable Roof Panels** Front Opening Hatch design changed; No drain holes required anymore. The drain holes entry and leveling was causing an issue for some customers, so this has been rectified in the latest version.

**Salient Features**

* Three removable (two front and one rear) top panels, rubber sealed against weather and rain.
* Concealed drain pipes between outer and inner layer.
* Top constructed in two layers which are filled with ceramic blankets to keep weather elements and sound out.
* Inner and outer layer highly reinforced for structural stability with integrated ribs.
* For ease of shipment all panels fit in a 6 X 4 box or in the rear cabin of the Thar.
* Once the 9 panels are assembled the top turns to a two piece one which can be removed or fitted back easily by anybody.
* No paint required as the outer resin is matte black and the inner is light grey colored.
* Two, fixed side glasses stuck on without beading.
